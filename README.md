This application (currently under development) is used to design and run psychological experiments. 

## Using the app for the first time on your computer:

Either the Windows 64-bit Installer or the macOS installer, depending on your computer.

2) Download the app onto your computer. 

3) Rename the folder containing the app for your project. 

4) Open the command prompt/terminal, and get inside the folder containing the app. E.g., if the app is located on your desktop, type `cd Desktop/yourgame`

5) Once inside the folder, enter these commands into the terminal one at a time:

Windows:

npm install -g @angular/cli
npm install typescript@3.2.4
npm install
```

## Running the app on your computer:
1) Get inside the folder containing the app. E.g., if the app is located on your desktop, type `cd Desktop/yourgame`

2) Once inside the folder, type: `ng serve`. Wait for the terminal to tell you that the app has been "compiled successfully."
